#  Gabby's Hotel System
**Autor:Gabriela Alvarez**
<br />APPS name: Hotel System 
<br />I will be creating an App to implement skills like OOP from my programming 2 class.
<br />/*This project will be a simple hotel System where the user can be an admin or costumer*/

<br />LO4.Compare and contrast the procedural/functional approach and the object-oriented approach
<br />-Procedural programming is composed of small parts called functions. Object- Oriented is based on objects. 
<br />Procedural programming follows top down approach vs Object- oriented follows bottom up approach. 

<br />LO5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
<br />Object oriented inheritance and subtyping goes hand by hand. Subtyping refers to compatibility of interfaces. Inheritance refers to reuse of implementation.
<br />LO7. Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments. 
<br />Interation is the process of repeting steps. Examples are "while", "do" and "for". You can find it in my hotel.cpp file 
<br />Exmples of operations that take functions as arguments. Paramaters are an example. A function that takes another function as argument is an argument
