<br />LO4.Compare and contrast the procedural/functional approach and the object-oriented approach
<br />-Procedural programming is composed of small parts called functions. Object- Oriented is based on objects. 
<br />Procedural programming follows top down approach vs Object- oriented follows bottom up approach. 

<br />LO5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
<br />Object oriented inheritance and subtyping goes hand by hand. Subtyping refers to compatibility of interfaces. Inheritance refers to reuse of implementation.
